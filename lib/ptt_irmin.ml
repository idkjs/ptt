(* XXX(dinosaure): we should be able to have different views
 * from this object such as the relay cares only about local
 * and targets and submission cares about password. *)

(* XXX(dinosaure): currently, we have the ability to get different
 * views if they share the same [pre_hash] function. But, such trick
 * is incompatible with a symchronization _in the fligth_.
 *
 * However, according to the current design of [ptt], it's currently
 * not easy to upgrade the local database _in the flight_ - due to
 * the functional aspect of the [Relay_map]. So it's probably possible
 * to apply the trick but not really sure that it is the best idea due
 * to implications. *)
